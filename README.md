# Summary

This project discovers equations from data using SINDy (sparse identification on nonlinear dynamics).

The code in this repro relates to the following blog posts:

* [Discovering equations from data using SINDy](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/sindy-lorenz/) &mdash; Under the directories "lorenz-custom" and "lorenz-pysindy".
* [Using PySINDy to discover equations from experimental data](https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/oscillator-pysindy/) &mdash; Under the directory "oscillator-pysindy".

Setup and running instructions can be found under each directory.
